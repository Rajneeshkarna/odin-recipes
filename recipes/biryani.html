    <h1>Biryani</h1>
    <p>This classic Indian blend of rice and chicken has more variants than any other Indian dish. Traditionally, this dish is prepared by marinating chicken or mutton in curd, and fragrant spices are mixed with rice then slow-cooked for hours. What keeps this dish interesting is the specific modifications made for various regions in India. Some keep it classic while some resort to mixing the rice with a pre-cooked gravy for the flavorsome moist appeal in the dish and then add the meat.</p>
