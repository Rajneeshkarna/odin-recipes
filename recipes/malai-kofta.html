    <h1>Malai-kofta</h1>
    <p>Malai kofta is the vegetarian version of meatballs. The balls can be made with a gourd (Lauki) or unripe bananas. They are cooked in a gravy of tomato, cream, and spices, the balls soaked in the flavors. People generally serve it with bread or rice. Although it is originally a Punjabi dish, its flavorsome appeal has been adopted by many restaurants over the globe.</p>
