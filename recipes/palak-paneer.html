    <h1>Palak-paneer</h1>
    <p>Palak Paneer is the perfect main course meal dish that is healthy, delicious, and at the same time very innovative. Made essentially with spinach and farmerâ€™s cottage cheese (paneer), this tops the list on a vegetarian menu in possibly every Indian restaurant abroad. Have it with naan or roti, and you have a complete meal, full of flavor and nutrients.</p>
